- We know the pain as developers who use multiple screens it's very hard especially if you have a small office space. where should i put the mouses and keyboards?

what if you can use one mouse and keyboard to control two computers isn't that amazing. So if you have a latop and a desktop(which obviously have mouse and keyboard) then you will remove the desktop's mouse and keyboard just only use your laptop, then when you want to use the desktop you open this program and do anything you want using only your laptop's mouse and keyboard
